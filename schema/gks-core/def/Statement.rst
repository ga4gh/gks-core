.. warning:: This data class is at a **draft** maturity level and may \
    change significantly in future releases. Maturity \
    levels are described in the :ref:`maturity-model`.

**Computational Definition**

A claim of purported truth as made by a particular agent, on a particular occasion. Statements may be used to simply put forth a possible fact (i.e. a 'proposition') as true, or to provide a more nuanced assessment of the level of confidence or evidence supporting a particular proposition.

**Information Model**

Some Statement attributes are inherited from :ref:`InformationEntity`.
