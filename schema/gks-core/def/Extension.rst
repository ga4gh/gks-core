.. note:: This data class is at a **trial use** maturity level and may \
    change in future releases. Maturity \
    levels are described in the :ref:`maturity-model`.

**Computational Definition**

The Extension class provides entities with a means to include additional attributes that are outside of the specified standard but needed by a given content provider or system implementer. These extensions are not expected to be natively understood, but may be used for pre-negotiated exchange of message attributes between systems.

**Information Model**

Some Extension attributes are inherited from :ref:`Element`.
