**Computational Definition**

An independent, evidence-based argument that may support or refute the validity of a specific proposition. The strength and direction of this argument is based on an interpretation of one or more pieces of information as evidence for or against the target proposition.

**Information Model**

Some EvidenceLine attributes are inherited from :ref:`InformationEntity`.
