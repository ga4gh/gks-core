  Disease:
    type: object

      of all or part of an organism and is not immediately due to any external injury.

# Sequence Feature related domain entities
  SequenceFeature:
    type: object
    inherits: gks.core-im:DomainEntity
    maturity: draft
    description: >-
      A sequence feature is an extent of 'located' biological sequence (gneomic, transcript, or protein),
      whose identity is determined by both its inherent sequence (ordering of monomeric units) and its 
      position (start and end coordinates based on alignment with some reference).
    $comment: >-
      Sequence Features can represent instances of a identified functional or structural elements (e.g. 
      a gene, transcript, promoter, exon), or arbitrary extents of sequence with no defined type, 
      function, or formal identifier (e.g. GRCh38.1 X:337456-337484).
    properties:
      type:
        type: string
        const: "SequenceFeature"
        default: "SequenceFeature"
        description: MUST be "SequenceFeature"
    subtype:
      $ref: "#/$defs/Coding"
      description: >-
        A more specific type of sequence feature (e.g. transcript, promoter, exon).
      $comment: >-
        This attribute can be used to report a more specific type for the Sequecnce Feature, in cases where
        the model does not define subclasses for these types. Implementers can define their own set
        of feature type codes/terms, based on the needs of their application.
